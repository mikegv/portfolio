                Hi, my name is Mike. I am a web developer who specializes in front end development. My main
                tools are Javascript, CSS and React.  I am currently working as a React apprentice for Bitwise Industries under Alpha Works in
                Fresno California. I am passionate about all things technology but especially love programming. In my free time
                you can find me spending time outdoors with my family and sometimes watching the some 80's horror movies.
                Feel free to contact me or check out my github using the links below.

        </motion.div>
